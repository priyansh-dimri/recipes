    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
        Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes, or
        according to package directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add butter and oil to a deep skillet over high heat. Add
        onions, and cook and stir until they take on a little color. Add sugar,
        salt, pepper, vinegar, and water, and continue to cook on high heat,
        stirring constantly, until onions are very tender and dark brown, about
        15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat down to low; add milk, garlic, thyme, and grated Parmesan.
        Blend the sauce until smooth with an immersion blender.

      <li>
        Drain pasta, reserving a small amount of water to thin sauce if needed.
        Stir pasta into sauce.
