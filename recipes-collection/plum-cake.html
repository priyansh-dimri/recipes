    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="ingredient-item">3 large eggs</li>
      <li class="ingredient-item">½ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li class="ingredient-item">½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li class="ingredient-item">1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
      <li class="ingredient-item">1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li class="ingredient-item">½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li class="ingredient-item">1 ¼ cups plums, pitted and quartered</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="steps-item">
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a
        9-inch tube pan.
      </li>
      <li class="steps-item">
        Separate eggs into whites and yolks. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks
        form; set aside.
      </li>
      <li class="steps-item">
        Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
        Beat in egg yolks and lemon zest.
      </li>
      <li class="steps-item">
        Stir flour and baking powder together, then blend into butter mixture.
        Gently fold in egg whites. Spread cake batter evenly into the prepared
        pan. There will only be a little over an inch of batter. Arrange plums,
        skin-side down, in a nice pattern over the batter.
      </li>
      <li class="steps-item">
        Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out
        clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool
        before serving.
