    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons baking soda</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk 1 cup flour, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Stir in water
        and softened butter until well combined. Let stand until bubbles begin
        to form, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir salt into yeast mixture, then gradually stir in 2 1/2 cups flour
        until dough can be picked up in a ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes, adding more flour if
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>Divide dough into 6 pieces and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Roll one piece into a 15-inch rope, then loop and twist rope into a
        pretzel shape. Place onto a baking sheet and form remaining pretzels.
        Cover and let rise for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking
        sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a pot. Stir in baking soda and remove
        from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip pretzels into the water bath for about 45 seconds, flipping over
        about halfway through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer soaked pretzels to the prepared baking sheet; brush with melted
        butter and sprinkle with salt.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
